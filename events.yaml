    for <a href="https://oreil.ly/2N8NU8p">What things are correlated with gender
    diversity: A dig through the ASF and Jupyter projects</a>.The talk covered: <p>Many
    of us believe that gender diversity in open source projects is important (for
    example, OReilly, Google, and the Python Software Foundation). (If you don''t,
    this isn''t going to convince you.) But what things are correlated with improved
    gender diversity, and what can we learn from similar historic industries?</p>


    <p>Holden Karau and Matt Hunt explore the diversity of different projects, examine
    historic EEOC complaints, and detail parallels and historic solutions. To keep
    things interesting, Holden and Matt conclude with a comparative analysis of the
    state of OSS and various complaints handled by the EEOC in the 60s, along with
    the solutions, suggestions, and binding settlements that were reached for similar
    diversity problems in other industries. This comparison is not legal advice but
    rather examples of what we can learn from early equal opportunity commission decisions.</p>


    <p>Topics include:</p>


    <ul>

    <li>Diversity of gender among the different levels of a given project''s leadership
    (committers, PMC, etc.)</li>

    <li>The existence of codes of conduct</li>

    <li>Language used in comments, code, and mailing lists</li>

  talk_description: "Apache Spark is an amazing distributed system, but part of the bargain we’ve made with the infrastructure deamons involves providing the correct set of magic numbers (aka tuning) or our jobs may be eaten by Cthulhu. Tuning Apache Spark is somewhat of a dark art, although thankfully, when it goes wrong all we tend to lose is several hours of our day and our employers money.

Holden Karau, Rachel Warren, and Anya Bida explore auto-tuning jobs using both historical and live job information, using systems like Apache BEAM, Mahout, and internal Spark ML jobs as workloads. Much of the data required to effectively tune jobs is already collected inside of Spark. You just need to understand it. Holden, Rachel, and Anya outline sample auto-tuners and discuss the options for improving them and applying similar techniques in your own work. They also discuss what kind of tuning can be done statically (e.g., without depending on historic information) and look at Spark’s own built-in components for auto-tuning (currently dynamically scaling cluster size) and how you can improve them.

Even if the idea of building an auto-tuner sounds as appealing as using a rusty spoon to debug the JVM on a haunted supercomputer, this talk will give you a better understanding of the knobs available to you to tune your Apache Spark jobs.

Also, to be clear, Holden, Rachel, and Anya don’t promise to stop your pager going off at 2:00am, but hopefully this helps."
