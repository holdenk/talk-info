  last_post_text: 'Thanks for joining us on 2018-08-24 at Jupytercon NY 2018 New York
    for <a href="https://oreil.ly/2N8NU8p">What things are correlated with gender
    diversity: A dig through the ASF and Jupyter projects</a>.The talk covered: <p>Many
    of us believe that gender diversity in open source projects is important (for
    example, OReilly, Google, and the Python Software Foundation). (If you don''t,
    this isn''t going to convince you.) But what things are correlated with improved
    gender diversity, and what can we learn from similar historic industries?</p>


    <p>Holden Karau and Matt Hunt explore the diversity of different projects, examine
    historic EEOC complaints, and detail parallels and historic solutions. To keep
    things interesting, Holden and Matt conclude with a comparative analysis of the
    state of OSS and various complaints handled by the EEOC in the 60s, along with
    the solutions, suggestions, and binding settlements that were reached for similar
    diversity problems in other industries. This comparison is not legal advice but
    rather examples of what we can learn from early equal opportunity commission decisions.</p>


    <p>Topics include:</p>


    <ul>

    <li>Diversity of gender among the different levels of a given project''s leadership
    (committers, PMC, etc.)</li>

    <li>The existence of codes of conduct</li>

    <li>Language used in comments, code, and mailing lists</li>

    <li>The rate of promotions for project participants</li>

    </ul>
