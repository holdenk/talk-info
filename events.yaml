    \ to automatically recognize when things have gone wrong so we can stop deployment\

    \ general techniques for validation, look at responses from people validating\
    \ big data jobs in production environments, and libraries that can assist us in\
    \ writing relative validation rules based on historical data.\nFor folks working\
    \ in streaming, we will talk about the unique challenges of attempting to validate\
    \ in a real-time system, and what we can do besides keeping an up-to-date resume\
    \ on file for when things go wrong. To keep the talk interesting real-world examples\
    \ (with company names removed) will be presented, as well as several creative-common\
    \ licensed cat pictures and an adorable panda GIF.\nIf you\u2019ve seen Holden\u2019\
    s previous testing Spark talks this can be viewed as a deep dive on the second\
    \ half focused around what else we need to do besides good testing practices to\
    \ create production quality pipelines. If you haven\u2019t seen the testing talks\
    \ watch those on YouTube after you come see this one"

    is still producing the correct results? Has it ever not? Have you not tricked
    anyone else into tacking over the pager for your system?

    As big data jobs move from the proof-of-concept phase into powering real production
    services, we have to start consider what will happen when everything eventually
    goes wrong (such as recommending inappropriate products or other decisions taken
    on bad data). This talk will attempt to convince you that we will all eventually

    our resumes.

    Figuring out when things have gone terribly wrong is trickier than it first appears,
    since we want to catch the errors before our users notice them (or failing that
    before CNN notices them). We will explore general techniques for validation, look
    at responses from people validating big data jobs in production environments,
    and libraries that can assist us in writing relative validation rules based on
    historical data.

    Once we feel like we''ve almost got it all under our belt, we will shift focus
    from traditional ETL pipelines to all of the wonderful special concerns that come
    with producing ML models and how we can (try) and validate that things are getting
    better (or at least not that much worse).</p>

  description: Big Data applications are increasingly being run on Kubernetes. Data
    scientists commonly use python-based workflows, with tools like PySpark and Jupyter
    for wrangling large amounts of data. The Kubernetes community over the past year
    has been actively investing in tools and support for frameworks such as Apache
    Spark, Jupyter and Apache Airflow. Attendees will learn how these tools can be
    used together to build a scalable self-service platform for data science on Kubernetes
    as well as the benefits that Kubernetes can provide over traditional options.

    \ in popularity in the last five years, but the nagging question remains, \u201C\
    How to put models into production?\u201D Engineers are typically tasked to build\
    \ one-off systems to serve predictions which must be maintained amid a quickly\
    \ evolving back-end serving space which has evolved from single-machine, to custom\
    \ clusters, to \u201Cserverless\u201D, to Docker, to Kubernetes. In this talk,\
    \ we present KubeFlow- an open source project which makes it easy for users to\
    \ move models from laptop to ML Rig to training cluster to deployment. In this\
    \ talk we will discuss, \u201CWhat is KubeFlow?\u201D, \u201Cwhy scalability is\
    \ so critical for training and model deployment?\u201D, and other topics.\nUsers\
    \ can deploy models written in Python\u2019s skearn, R, Tensorflow, Spark, and\
    \ many more. The magic of Kubernetes allows data scientists to write models on\
    \ their laptop, deploy to an ML-Rig, and then devOps can move that model into\
    \ production with all of the bells and whistles such as monitoring, A/B tests,\
    \ multi-arm bandits, and security."

  date: 2018-10-09
  description: 'Distributed systems can seem magical, and sometimes all of the magic
    works and our job succeeds. However, if you''ve worked with them for a long enough
    time you''ve found a few places where the magic starts to break down and the fact
    that it''s actually a collection of several hundred garden gnomes* rather than
    a single large garden gnome.

    This talk will use Apache Spark, Beam, Flink, Kafka, and Map Reduce to explore
    the world of data parallel distributed systems. We''ll start with some happy pieces
    of magic, like how we can combine different transformations into a single pass
    over the data, working between different languages, data partitioning, and lambda
    serialization. After each new piece of magic is introduced we''ll look at how
    it breaks in one (or two) of the systems.

    Come to be told it''s not your fault everything is broken, or if your distributed
    software still works an exciting preview of everything that''s going to go wrong.
    Don''t work with distributed systems? Come to be reassured you''ve made good life
    choices.'

? Scala eXchange 2018:Validating Big Data Jobs - Stopping Failures before Production
  (w/ Spark, BEAM, & friends!) -- now with Scooters
: {blog_fmt_text: null, codelab_link: null, copresenters: null, date: 2018-12-14,
  description: ' As big data jobs move from the proof-of-concept phase into powering
    real production services, you will need to consider what will happen when everything
    eventually goes wrong (such as recommending inappropriate products or other decisions
    taken on bad data).

    During this talk, you will discover that you will eventually get aboard the failboat
    (especially with ~40% of respondents automatically deploying their Spark jobs
    results to production). It''s important to automatically recognise when things
    have gone wrong, so you can stop deployment before you have to update our resumes.

    Figuring out when things have gone terribly wrong is trickier than it first appears,
    since you want to catch the errors before your users notice them (or failing that
    before CNN notices them). We will explore general techniques for validation, look
    at responses from people validating big data jobs in production environments,
    and libraries that can assist you in writing relative validation rules based on
    historical data. For folks working in streaming, you will learn about the unique
    challenges of attempting to validate in a real-time system, and what you can do
    besides keeping an up-to-date resume on file for when things go wrong.

    You will discover code examples in Apache Spark, as well as learn about similar
    concepts in Apache BEAM (a cross platform tool), but the techniques should be
    applicable across systems.

    Real-world examples (with company names removed) will be presented, as well as
    several creative-common licensed cat pictures and an adorable panda GIF.', discussion_link: null,

    error messages. Even attending Spark Summit over the past few years you have seen
    talks like the "Top K Mistakes in Spark." While cool non-machine learning based
    tools do exist to examine Sparks logs  they dont use machine learning and therefore
    are not as cool but also limited in by the amount of effort humans can put into
    writing rules for them. This talk will look what happens when we train "regular"
    clustering models on stack traces, and explore DL models for classifying user
    message to the Spark list. Come for the reassurance that the robots are not yet
    able to fix themselves, and stay to learn how to work better with the help of
    our robot friends. The tl;dr of this talk is Spark ML on Spark output, plus a
    little bit of Tensorflow is fun for the whole family, but probably shouldnt automatically

    but part of the bargain weve made with the infrastructure deamons involves providing
    the correct set of magic numbers (aka tuning) or our jobs may be eaten by Cthulhu.
    Tuning Apache Spark is somewhat of a dark art, although thankfully, when it goes
    wrong, all we tend to lose is several hours of our day and our employers money.

    Holden Karau, Rachel Warren, and Anya Bida explore auto-tuning jobs using both
    historical and live job information, using systems like Apache BEAM, Mahout, and
    internal Spark ML jobs as workloads. Much of the data required to effectively
    tune jobs is already collected inside of Spark. You just need to understand it.
    Holden, Rachel, and Anya outline sample auto-tuners and discuss the options for
    improving them and applying similar techniques in your own work. They also discuss
    what kind of tuning can be done statically (e.g., without depending on historic
    information) and look at Sparks own built-in components for auto-tuning (currently
    dynamically scaling cluster size) and how you can improve them.

    Even if the idea of building an auto-tuner sounds as appealing as using a rusty
    spoon to debug the JVM on a haunted supercomputer, this talk will give you a better
    understanding of the knobs available to you to tune your Apache Spark jobs.

    on 2018-09-13 at Strata NY 2018 New York, NY, USA for <a href="https://oreil.ly/2LT6QU0">Understanding
    Spark tuning with auto-tuning; or, Magical spells to stop your pager going off</a>.The
    talk covered: <p>Apache Spark is an amazing distributed system, but part of the
    bargain weve made with the infrastructure deamons involves providing the correct
    set of magic numbers (aka tuning) or our jobs may be eaten by Cthulhu. Tuning
    Apache Spark is somewhat of a dark art, although thankfully, when it goes wrong
    all we tend to lose is several hours of our day and our employers money.

    Holden Karau, Rachel Warren, and Anya Bida explore auto-tuning jobs using both
    historical and live job information, using systems like Apache BEAM, Mahout, and
    internal Spark ML jobs as workloads. Much of the data required to effectively
    tune jobs is already collected inside of Spark. You just need to understand it.
    Holden, Rachel, and Anya outline sample auto-tuners and discuss the options for
    improving them and applying similar techniques in your own work. They also discuss
    what kind of tuning can be done statically (e.g., without depending on historic
    information) and look at Sparks own built-in components for auto-tuning (currently
    dynamically scaling cluster size) and how you can improve them.

    Even if the idea of building an auto-tuner sounds as appealing as using a rusty
    spoon to debug the JVM on a haunted supercomputer, this talk will give you a better
    understanding of the knobs available to you to tune your Apache Spark jobs.

    Also, to be clear, Holden, Rachel, and Anya dont promise to stop your pager going
    off at 2:00am, but hopefully this helps.</p>

  description: "There are many great tools for training machine learning tools, ranging\
    \ from sci-kit to Apache Spark, and tensorflow. However many of these systems\
    \ largely leave open the question how to use our models outside of the batch world\
    \ (like in a reactive application). Different options exist for persisting the\
    \ results and using them for live training, and we will explore the trade-offs\
    \ of the different formats and their corresponding serving/prediction layers.\
    \ We'll tie this all together with Kubeflow as well as showing how it can be used\
    \ with different systems. Time permitting we\u2019ll talk about designing clients\
    \ for graceful degradation when everything eventually catches on fire."
